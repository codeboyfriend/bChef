### Tech Stack
This project uses:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

### Prerequisites
Before installation, you need to have the following: 
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed
- Basic knowledge of [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Basic knowledge of [Github](https://github.com/)

### Steps
1. [Fork](https://github.com/codeboyfriend/bChef/fork) this repository. 
2. In your terminal, clone your fork repository using `git clone <link to your fork>`.
3. Run `cd bChef` to navigate to project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to add node_modules folder.
5. To start the server on localhost, run `npm start`.
6. Make your changes, push your code, and open a pull request.

### Adding a recipe
Before adding a recipe, please make sure that the new recipe does not already exist. You can easily check this by entering the recipe on the [live](https://bchef.netlify.app/) site to see if its gives a result or not. Or checking the [database](https://github.com/codeboyfriend/bChef/blob/master/public/server/db.json) to see if its already exist.

>We use [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) to store the recipes.

1. In the `/public` folder, open the `/server` folder and subsequently, the `db.json` file you find in it. You can see that each meal is a JSON object of its own with a `name`, `cover`, `description`, `youtube`, `recipe` and `instruction`.

2. To add a new recipe, you must append a new object to this file. 
    - The meal which is the key  must be in lowercase. For example, `noodles` not `Noodles` or `NOODLES`
    - The name must be in sentence case. For example, `Gbegiri soup`
    - Cover must be a link to the image of the meal.
    - Description should contain a short note about the meal. It must not be too lengthy.
    - Youtube must contain verified link to a youtube video on how to prepare the meal.
    - Recipe must be an array of the ingredients needed for preparing the meal.
    - Instruction must be an array of steps to follow when preparing the meal.
